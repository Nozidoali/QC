State Preparation Circuits
--------------------------

Inputs are `np.ndarray` vectors dumped as pickle files. 
Ouputs are two quantum circuits using standard OpenQASM 2.0 syntax.
- The complex gates are mapped to Ry and CX (also CX_oFalse) gates.
- The files without suffix and with `opt` are QSP circuits.
- The unitary of two circuits are not necessarily the same, but the final state is the same.

Files are named after
- `<State Family>_<num_qubits>_<cardinality>.<pkl/[opt].qasm>`

Following are the description of the state families:
- `W_n_<m>`: W state with n qubits, the amplitude of |x> is non-zero if the binary representation of x only contains n-1 |0>s and one |1>. The cardinality m = n. 
- `Dicke_n_<m>`: Dicke states with n qubits, m = C_n^k, the amplitude of |x> is non-zero if the binary representation of x only contains n-k |0>s and k |1>. 
    + `Dicke-Dense` states have k = 2
    + `Dicke-Sparse` states have k = n/2 
- `QBA_n_m`: Quantum Byzantine Algorithm states, the amplitude of |x> is non-zero if x is lower than $m$
    + `QBA-Dense` states have m = 2^(n-1) + 1
    + `QBA-Sparse` states have m = 2^(n-1) - 1
- `Rand-<Dense/Sparse>-<Uniform/NonUniform>` states have their amplitudes generated randomly. The amplitudes of uniform states are the same for all the basis vectors in the index set, while amplitudes of nonuniform states are random real numbers between 0 and 1. Post-processing are applied to normalize these states.
    + `Dense` states have m = 2 ^ (n-1)
    + `Sparse` states have m = n
